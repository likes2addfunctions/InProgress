<h2>Sylow Theorems [Hungerford p.92-95] </h2>
<h3> Sylow 1</h3>
Let $G$ be a group of order $p^{n}m$ with $p$ and $m$ relatively prime and $n > 0$.  Then $G$
contains a subgroup of order $p^i$ for each $1 \leq i \leq n$ and when $i < n$ 
each subgroup of order $p^i$ is normal in a subgroup of order $p^{i+1}$

<h3> Definitions </h3>  
A group in which every element has order a power of some prime $p$ is called a $p$-group.

A maximal $p$-subgroup of a group $G$ is called a $p$-sylow subgroup. 

<h3> Sylow 2</h3>
    All $p$-Sylow subgroups of a finite group $G$ are conjugate.
    
<h3> Sylow 3</h3>
    If $G$ is finite and $|G|$ is divisible by $p$ then the number of $p$-sylow subgroups 
    divides $|G|$ and is $ 1 mod p$. 
    
<h2>Orbit Stabilizer Theorem [La94 prop 1.5.1 (p27-28)] </h2>
Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $S$. For $s \in S$, denote by $G_{s}$ the set of $x \in G$ 
such that $xs=s$ and denote by $Gs$ the set of $y \in S$ such that $y = gs$ for some $g \in G$.
Then the order of $Gs$ is equal to the index $[G:G_{s}]$.


    
<h2>Lagrange's Theorem [Hungerford p.39] </h2>
If $H$ is a subgroup of a group $G$ then $|G| = [G:H]|H|$. In particular if 
$|G|$ is finite then $|a|$ divides $|G|$ for all $a \in G$.

<h2>Euler totient function [Hungerford p.297] </h2>
The function $\phi: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that 
$\phi(n)$ is the number of positive integers $i < n$ such that $gcd(i,n) = 1$. 
    
<h2>Euler Theorem [Her75 p.43] </h2>
    
<h2>Structure Theorem (for finite groups) [Hungerford  p.96] </h2>
Let $p > q$ be primes. If $q$ does not divide $(p-1)$ then every group of order $pq$ is isomorphic to
the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_{pq}$. Otherwise there are 2 distict groups of order $pq$, $\mathbb{Z}_{pq}$
and a non-abelian group $K$ generated by $c$ and $d$ such that $|c| = p$, $|d| = q$ and $dc = c^{s}d$ where
$s \ncong 1\ mod\ p$ and $s^{q} \cong 1\ mod\ p$

<h2>Method for decomposing groups via diagonalization [Her75 p.343] </h2>
    
<h2>Cayley's Theorem [Her75 p.71] </h2>
Let $A(G)$ denote the set of permutations of the elements of $G$. Then $G$ there is 
a monomorphism $G \rightarrow A(G)$.  So every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.
