<h1>Theorems and Skills for Metric Spaces</h1>
</center>

<h2>Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem</h2>
Any bounded sequence in a metric space has a convergent subsequence.





<h2>Baire Category Theorem</h2>
Suppose $G_{n}$ are countably many open, dense subsets of a metric space $M$, 
then $\displaystyle \cap_{n} G_{n}$ is still dense in $M$.

<p>
A complete metric space can not be written as the complement of such an intersection. 
</p>

<h2>Cantor Set</h2>
The traditional Cantor set is made by removing the interval $(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3})$ from $[0,1]$.
Then repeatedly removing the open middle third interval from the leftover pieces. 

<p>
The Cantor Set it a compact, non-empty, perfect and toally disconnected set.
</p>

<p>
Given any compact, non-empty metric space $M$, there is a surjection from the Cantor Set onto $M$.
</p>

<h2>Heine-Borel Theorem</h2>
A closed bounded subset of a metric space is compact. 

<h2>Convergence of Cauchy Sequences</h2>
Cauchy Squences converge in metric spaces. 

<i>A sequence $x_{n}$ is $Cauchy$ if for any $\epsilon >0$ there is $N$ such that
$d(x_{n},x_{m}) < \epsilon$ for all $n,m >N$. </i>

<h2>Brouwer Fixed point theorem</h2>
Let $B^{n}$ denote the closed unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then any continuous function
$f: \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}$ has a fixed point.  

<h2>Contraction Mapping Principle</h2>
Let $M$ be a complete metric space and $f:M \rightarrow M$ be a contraction, 
then $f$ has a unique fixed point $p$ and for any $x \in M$,
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f^{n}(x) = p$$
where $f^{n}$ denotes the $n$-fold composition $f \circ f \circ \dotd \circ f(x)$
